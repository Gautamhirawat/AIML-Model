##  What Youâ€™ll Learn:

You will learn how to apply this model in your data analysis and how to predict its outcome.
this is basic model that is helpful and have a decent score of prediction . 


##  Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression is an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events. It is a statistical method used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis

**Line of regression = Best fit line for a model**



## Project Structure: 

**[Real Estate Pricing](Real_Estate_Pricing)**: In real estate MLR is used to predict property prices based on multiple factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. This helps buyers and sellers understand market trends and set competitive prices.

**[Agricultural Yield Prediction](Agricultural_Yield_Prediction)**: Farmers can use MLR to estimate crop yields based on several variables like rainfall, temperature, soil quality and fertilizer usage. This information helps in planning agricultural practices for optimal productivity.

**[E-commerce Sales Analysis](E-commerce_Sales_Analysis)**: An e-commerce company can utilize MLR to assess how various factors such as product price, marketing promotions and seasonal trends impact sales.
